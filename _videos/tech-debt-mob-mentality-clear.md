Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. Is laziness in software development good or bad? How about a lack of focus? When is it good for a system to favor short attention spans? When is it not so good? Join Chris and Austin as they have a lively discussion with Dustin Thostenson on the topic of "Clear & Simple." They first dive into learning by doing, katas, understanding others, and being understood. Then they not only explore the paradoxes involved in laziness and focus but also share about how those things tie into improving interpersonal skills via mob programming.

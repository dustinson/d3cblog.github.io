(this blog is currently under development)

A new team member with a new computer is the first test which may offer a real look into how this person will impact your the team and organization.  

Setting up a new computer system can be an easy or challenging activity.
It's common for this activity, which happens relatively infrequently, to be undocumented and unknown.
In the best case scenario the team has adopted an Infrastructure as Code practice and can run a script to setup a new computer with all the software and settings necessary to get up and running.  
Maybe they have Brew or Chocolatey and a combination of other tools to make this happen.  

Maybe the license key was floating around in someone else's desk who is on vacation.
And please be sure you are installing right version of the software.  If it's too new or too old you won't be able to compile the code. Do you have all the right 3rd party tools installed with the right version and an active license?Worse yet, you can, but it's wrong.  


How do you know when your system is actually working? 

This has probably brought back some anxious flashbacks. Memories of overwhelming times with too little support arrise.  

This is a test because how the people involve response may predict the future success of the team.  
Who is too busy to help?
Who is confident in referring to legacy organizational patterns which favor local optimization, deferring every question to an SME (who may not actually be the SME, but is just saddled with that responsibility)?
Who is dismissive that improvments could be made? They've already done the Cost Benefit Return On Investment calculations (withouth any numbers) and determined they juice isn't worth the squeeze to improve the process.
Who is able to think of ways this could be improved?  Can they think of some process or tool implementations which could make this a bit simpler?  Do they belive that creating a new dedicated role for this setup is the best option so that person or team can get everyone's new system setup and make sure the new team member is writing their if statements and for loops ASAP?
Who is willing to make the improvements?
Are they willing to at least write down the steps and make them available for the next dev?
Are they willing to try some tools out?

This is a very important time to pay attention to how people respond.  

No team or company is perfect. Everyone has a process which could be a little bit better.  
The difference to look for is who's making those changes.  

If the new member expects the company to solve all their problems, they will continue to work within those constraints.  They may continue to accept the status quo and  expect others to solve their problems.  Worse yet, they may make decisions which minimize any risk that could break them out of their comfort zone.  There are places where they won't make any changes because if something goes wrong they don't know how to fix it.  

There is a natural atrophy in systems where improvements are not being made.
"Any system which is not under review is a system in decline".

If you are a tech lead on a team with a new employee, looks to see how they respond.  If  you have a person who just wants to get by, be concerned.  If you have a person willing to make things better, support them.  Maybe give them time to make the onboarding process 10% better.  When the next person joins, have the elder new-hire onboard them.  Let them enjoy that the process wasn't as painful and challenge they new-new person to make it 10% better.  
Establish that mindset up front.  Support it. 

As a new hire, pay attention to those who are open to hearing new ideas and supporting them.  If you are interested in expanding your abilites and make an impact this is your chance.

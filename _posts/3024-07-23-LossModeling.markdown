Loss Modeling

Opportunity 

Understand what people are feeling and fearing.  
Understand how these motivations may influence behaviors, and make outcomes more elusive.  

Perspective-based approach.  Start with what motivates people most - Loss Avoidance is greater than potential gains.
Our hopes can be defined from our fears.  

I'm afraid of losing my house, so I try to make money. 
I'm afraid of losing my comfort in life, so I buy insurance and save money.  
I'm afraid of losing time with my kids, so I try to listen to them and schedule vacations with them. 

When the economy is challenged, my anxiety increases.  
When my family argues, I worry they will distance themselves from me.  

who is this for?
- humans
  - Team members 
    - to be heard
    - to know how to support each other
    - to understand the system they work in
    - to know what improvements could reduce loss and increase chances of success
  - leaders to
    - better understand how their system is understood
    - see how interdependencies impact each other.
    - focus on experiments which could improve the overall system. 
  - (role titles may not really matter, it's more about how people sense and respond to the system)
- 

Outcome
- clarity of reality (what you see is all there is)
- simplified risk management. 
- Increased engagement, empowerment.
- real time feedback for changing landscapes (assuming this is a tool which people could update whenever they wanted.)
- prioritized, actionable experiments.
- more responsive, less reactive systemic changes


<h1 style="">A</h1><h3>How does it Work?</h3>
Individuals, Teams and companies  


Facilitation
- working agreements
- 
- Self
  - List your roles or responsibilities
  - what are your biggest risks in this role?  How could you be considered poor at your job, or what could cause problems?  How those problems impact you (we can talk about how they impact others later)
  - What would the impact be of those problems, to yourself, your team, your stakeholders or users?
  - How likely is it those risks are realized?
  - what would trigger, contribute or amplify to the likelihood they would occur?
  - What would trigger, contribute or amplify the impact?
  - How would you rank the role risks?  Does that correlate with the weighting of the liklihood and impact?
  - ~ Refine only personal loss first
    - consider using Maslow for some recommendations of categories, and sequencing for focus.
    - i.e. loss of life, job, house, money, reputation, community, happiness, dream achievement.  
    - 
- Team
  - affinity map individual risks. 
  - - bonus: allow others to ask or recommend lossess to teammates they may have consciously or unconsiously omitted.  
    - -- i.e. if someone is known to like being known for their expertise, would democratizing decision making make them feel a loss they didn't aknowledge.
  - Consolidate individual roles to team

  - group vote on rankings for role goals (you cannot tell Chris that their fear of being fired is individually illigitimate, but you can belive the chance of your team's contract being cancelled has a lower liklihood)
    - i.e. if only 1 person is worried about a job, then it doens't weigh as heavily for the team.  
    - if everyone is worried about their dept getting cut, that would rank higher.
  - build relationships?  visualize?
    - i.e. how can one role impact another, positively or negatively.  
      - i.e. developers working till the end of the sprint increases failure potential for QA.  this can be mitigated by smaller stories, reduced use of deadline when impacts are high or clarity of what a dalay would do.
      - risks from dependencies form external teams.
      - sidenote - much of this conversation is trending towards risk mitigation.  clarify that the only real risk people care about is suffering a loss of job, reputation, sleep, perceived control, real or imagined power, etc.

Model roadmap
-   Explore
      -  Validate the idea may provide value
        - Friends/industry experts
        - common consumers
      - Does it appear to fit a need?
      - Is it easy and obvious to understand the purpose, practice? 
  -   Build prototype 
    - Loss Model
    - workshop 
    - engagement model
    - - Groups to pilot prototype
        agileIowa
    - podcasts - Dr Dave, LLwellen, mob mentality
  - people () /certification process
    - 
- Expand
 - Product (model)
 - Process (workshops, engagements )
 - People (practitioners)

- Extract
 - product - self service, anonymous app to reflect sentiment. 
 - Process - template, checklist
 - people/practitioners - certification

Misc thoughts
- this is not a new Agile operating framework.  It is not a prescriptive process which guarentees results or ROI when implemented "correcty"
- It is Agile adjacent.  An attempt to address the real problems people and teams face which may exist under the surface, but weakens the foundation of practices and processes promised to promote productivity. 
- It's an application of agile principles, psychological tendendancies and ???
- It helps make sense of a system before experiments are inflicted on the system to improve it. 
- It helps prioritizes focal areas based on changing risk profiles.
- It is sensing and responding.
- It enhances engagement, and informs initiatives.
- It's based on the experienced belief that
  - Systems are complex.  Nobody really understand how they work together.  It's easier to locally optimize one part of the system with little understanding of consequences.
  - - Signal to noise issues make it harder to understand a system. 
  - People are positively motivated by Purpose, Autonomy and Mastery
  - People are negatively motivated by loss aversion, at the cost to the larger system ( especially when no direct impact of the consequences cascades to them. -- not my circus, not my monkies.)
  - Given the opportunity, people want to improve the lives and environment for themselves and those they work with.
  - Bring in more ideas from unknown-unknowns into the known unknowns, better define the questions people need to seek answers for, and provide better context for options to remedy or mitigate.  
  - Increase simplicity with more accuracy, and the appropriate level of precision of detail.  

word cloud/affinity map

- Assumptions
  - people want to improve their lives and the lives of the people around them
  - People want to improve the experiences for their customers, to the benefit of their company.
  - current systems are not fully understood
  - People want to feel safe, and exist in a state of flow.
  - People will treat others better if they understand their hopes and fears.  Or at least make reasonable accomidations when conflicting goals exist.
  - Nobody is a villian in their own story.  They are simply working with the constraints they face, based on avoiding losses and striving for gains, safely.  
  - - never attribute malice to incompentence.  individual decisions are meant to benefit the individual first, and their team second.
  - People desire to be acknowledged.

"The times, they are a-changing" - Bob Dylan

If you've been a coach or practitioner leading transformations, you know what Bob's talking about.
"Agile" has become a punchline in some circles. Using the "Agile" label like "Smurf" may no longer be helpful.
The market is changing, and we need to change with it.
How do we maintain enthusiasm and foster continuous improvement in this new landscape?

This isn't an "Agile is Dead" rant.
It's a pragmatic discussion , diverging from theoretical and dogmatic practices of recent years.

Let's embark on a journey to understand how we arrived here and explore the opportunities that lie ahead.
Our discussion will cover:
- The evolving timeline and critical inflection points in Agile's journey.
- Foundational concepts that have proven effective.
- Growing resentment stemming from failed practices.
- Tactics to fuel your improvement journey and career.

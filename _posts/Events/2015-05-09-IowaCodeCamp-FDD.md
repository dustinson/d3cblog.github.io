Presented Failure Driven Development at <a href='http://iowacodecamp.com' target='new'>Iowa Code Camp</a>.

<a href='https://prezi.com/5744uxzvdc4q/failure-driven-development/' target='new'>'Failure Driven Development'</a> is a discussion around career development which follows the model of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.
The conversation shares stories of career failures when different needs are being sought.
It's through learning what doesn't work that we learn what does, so let's embrace those failures.

Those Failures around compensation or contract negotiation.  
The Technical and Interpersonal problems we face.
Our ability to work with ourselves, or in teams.
The goals we seek.

While the slide deck leaves much to the imagination, perhaps the .NET Rocks podcast may shed more light.

Please reach out if you would like to discuss these topics more.  They are quite fun to cover!

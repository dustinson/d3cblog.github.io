The <a href='https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MWzsxFWKZzV6j7m-qfgQ5rZVId0OLYZ2a3Ylqtnbis4/edit?usp=sharing' target='new'>'Rage Against The Management'</a> talk at Iowa Code Camp represented an early foray into the non-technical aspects of programming.
This was an attempt to share experiences and lessons learned from a decade in the industry and a few years of being independent.  

There is no clear model here, but several decent places to have meaningful conversations.

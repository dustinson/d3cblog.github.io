Presented <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9estVuIo4_k&list=PLu5A5CyoWE0aYG6Fosb113fD_VQv3-VRn&index=5' target='new'>'Failure to Launch: Common Consulting Crashes'</a> presentation.

This talk was created after watching too many people fail as they tried to help others.  
We explore the exchanges between the client and the consultant.  
There are often many aspects to that balance which are not considered by either party, often resulting in fighting and failures.

Lets explore what we want to give and receive what what they are willing to accept and return.

After being in the field for 15 years and being an independent consultant for 5 years, I shared my ideas on how to manage your career to hit a significant financial milestone in 5 years.
The talk was called <a href='https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TmwuMTHqyeXifnPGmdFh3RZp9QGpsgXM/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111694679680268309106&rtpof=true&sd=true' target='new'>5Years6Digits</a>.
Choosing to be deliberate instead of accidental, there are decisions which can be made to accelerate a career.

I met and became friends with Cory House at this event, which he journaled here on <a href='https://www.bitnative.com/2013/03/17/nebraska-code-camp-2013-lessons-learned' target='new'>Cory House's BitNative Blog</a>.
In this blog, Cory mentioned his upcoming "Outliers" talk that he worked on.  This was a revolutionary moment for Cory.  

Cory's <a href='https://vimeo.com/97415346' target='new'>Outlier Talk</a>, based on Malcolm Gladwell's book of the same name, has resonated with tens of thousands of people around the world.  
I highly recommend taking the time to explore.
